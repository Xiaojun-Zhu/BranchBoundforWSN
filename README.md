# BranchBoundforWSN

CPLEX is required to use these codes.

## Network generation

File 'networks30to100.txt' contains all problems used in the paper. 

The code that generates these networks is `GenerateReadWriteNetwork.java`

## Implemented algorithms

Algorithms are implemented in java classes with prefix 'Alg'. For example, BB is implemented in AlgBB. 

EvalScript.java contains code we used to run the algorithms on problem instances.
